            Dear Mannu,
        </p>
        <p>
          Hey, 
            Kavisha come into my life unexpectedly when we meet first time in the csed department and 
            you text me about your ppt and on my given suggestion you update it and send me about 6 in 
            just three hours it was the first thing i liked about you or i was impressed with. When i 
            asked you to join us for the hackthon i really do not have any feelings but after that when
            we started to meet they developed. I don't know what is the problem with you i think that 
            you are afraid of getting attach to someone you think that the person you are attached with 
            will leave you after a certain time but i promise you to not to leave you. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‚
